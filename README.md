# Spin-Coater

Functions and scripts for image-processing and other data analysis used in
undergraduate project studying fluid dynamical instabilities while rinsing
a silicon wafer on a spin coater. The goal of this project was to identify
the conditions that led to a catastrophic flow instability while cleaning
silicon wafers to improve a novel, green method for wafer-cleaning developed
by Lam Research.

The work for the project was performed by Andy Ylitalo under the mentorship
of John M. Frostad and with help from Dan Walls in Gerald Fuller's lab at
Stanford University from 2015-2017. Additional analysis and publications
were completed 2017 - 2019.
